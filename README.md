# Tidy Tracks

Tidy Tracks addresses privacy concerns by allowing users to remove potentially unwanted elements from GPS tracks.

## Download

An executable jar file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/WalterHummel/TidyTracks/raw/master/bin/TidyTracks.jar).

## Requirements

Tidy Tracks requires [Java](http://java.com/en/download/) 8u40 or later.

## What Tidy Tracks Is

 - Tidy Tracks is a program that can remove sensitive information from GPS tracks, such as dates and times or metadata. This is useful when preparing a track for the Internet. 

 - Tidy Tracks can also be used as a workaround for [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) to view historical imagery and GPS tracks at the same time.
 
In Google Earth the Time and Date Slider used to show the progress of a track is the same as the Historical Imagery Slider.

The user slides the slider to view other images, but if the image date is older than the currently displayed track the track will disappear from the map.

Tidy Tracks provides an easy workaround by allowing users to save a copy of the GPS track without time data.

Once a track is imported into Google Earth without time data the user is free to view historical imagery without worry of the track disappearing from the map.

## What Tidy Tracks Is _Not_

 - Tidy Tracks is not for reducing GPS tracks. As in removing individual points from a GPS track based on proximity to other track points, distance intervals, etc.

 - Tidy Tracks is also not for converting between GPS formats. 

Please see the [GPSBabel project](http://www.gpsbabel.org/) for these features.

## Supported Formats
